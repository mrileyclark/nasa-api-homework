## How It's Made: 

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Nasa Api

BeerFinder API - Developed a JavaScript application that utilizes 
the Open Brewery DB API to find breweries in a given city. The user enters 
the city name, and the application fetches relevant brewery data from the API. The 
information is then dynamically displayed in a table format, including details 
such as brewery name, address, city, state, and website URL. I ensured the application
handles potential null values for brewery names and website URLs, following best 
practices for data presentation and error handling.

 ## Lessons Learned: 

I plan on revisting the app to add a sort option for users to have the ability
to sort duplicate city names.
